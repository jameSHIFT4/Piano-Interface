# Piano Project

This is a simple piano interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project (which I got from freeCodeCamp) includes visual representation of piano keys with styles and hover effects.

## Features

- Responsive piano layout that adjusts for different screen sizes.
- Hover and active effects on the piano keys to simulate interaction.
- Custom hover and active state effects on the username `jameSHIFT4` in the footer.
- Support for various media queries to maintain usability on different device sizes.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the piano interface.
